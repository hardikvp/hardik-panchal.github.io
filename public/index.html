            <h2 class="text-3xl font-light text-gray-900">More About Me</h2>
            <div class="space-y-6 text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                <p class="text-lg">I'm a first-gen engineer, Carnegie Mellon grad, and AI builder.</p>
                <p>
                    I started my journey in chemical engineering, designing one of India's fastest ATVs, publishing solar
                    energy research, and developing nanotech catalytic converters. Later, I developed machine learning
                    algorithms at ExxonMobil to detect oil density across offshore rigs and that's where I truly fell in love
                    with AI.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Within a year, I pivoted into software and AI, landing roles in product, ML, and engineering. Over 8+
                    years, I worked across global tech teams, learning what makes great products, how companies hire, and why
                    traditional hiring leaves so much potential on the table.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, I'm building for those without a straight path in, because talent doesn't always come with a
                    perfect r√©sum√©, and a perfect r√©sum√© doesn't always mean real talent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I build tools to make hiring clearer and kinder, where opportunity meets potential, and companies don't
                    waste time sifting through noise.
                </p>
                <p class="font-medium text-gray-900">
                    I believe hard work beats talent, and staying focused on your own journey matters most. Potential is
                    everywhere, we just need smarter ways to discover and support it.
